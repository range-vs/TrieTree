### This repository contains incomplete STL support for the Trie tree implementation. You can always add it if necessary.

Functions:
+ basic operations of search, insertion, deletion;
+ iterators;
+ analogue of the std::inserter iterator.

P.S.: insert operation does not support arguments - iterators.
